## Overview

This directory contains practical usage guides for gene calling and RNA-feature tools used in the bio-gene-calling skill.

## Tools

### Prokaryotic and viral gene calling

- **[pyrodigal.md](pyrodigal.md)** - Pyrodigal v3.7.1, Python bindings and CLI around Prodigal for bacteria and archaea
  - Fast prokaryotic gene prediction
  - Metagenomic and single-genome modes
  - CLI compatible with common Prodigal workflows plus Python output writers
  - Thread-safe parallel processing
  - Source: https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal

- **[pyrodigal-gv.md](pyrodigal-gv.md)** - pyrodigal-gv v0.3.2 for viruses, including giant viruses and alternative-code viruses
  - Use the `pyrodigal-gv` CLI or `pyrodigal_gv.ViralGeneFinder`, not the retired standalone `prodigal-gv` workflow
  - Distributes the prodigal-gv viral metagenomic model set (`PRODIGAL_GV_VERSION` v2.11.0)
  - Source: https://github.com/althonos/pyrodigal-gv

### Eukaryotic gene calling

- **BRAKER4** - current upstream eukaryotic annotation workflow; pin the tested release and container digest from <https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER4>
- **[braker.md](braker.md)** - legacy BRAKER3 v3.0.8 reproduction guide
  - Combines GeneMark-ETP and AUGUSTUS internally (AUGUSTUS is not run as a standalone tool)
  - RNA-seq and protein evidence integration
  - Automated training
  - Upstream README marks BRAKER as deprecated in favor of BRAKER4; keep BRAKER3 only where this workflow explicitly requires it
  - Source: https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER

### RNA gene detection

- **[trnascan-se.md](trnascan-se.md)** - tRNA detection with tRNAscan-SE v2.0.12
  - Covariance model-based; isotype-specific models
  - Bacterial, archaeal, eukaryotic modes
  - Uses Infernal v1.1-era covariance-model searches
  - Source: https://github.com/UCSC-LoweLab/tRNAscan-SE

- **[infernal.md](infernal.md)** - Infernal v1.1.5 `cmsearch` for rRNA and other ncRNA detection against Rfam covariance models
  - Replaces barrnap as the default rRNA caller in this workflow
  - Domain-appropriate Rfam models (SSU, LSU, 5S, 5.8S; mitochondrial 12S/16S where applicable) — see SKILL.md for the model list

## Quick reference

| Tool | Checked version | Organism type | Mode | Typical use case |
|------|-----------------|---------------|------|------------------|
| pyrodigal | 3.7.1 | Bacteria, archaea | Meta / single | Fast prokaryotic gene calling |
| pyrodigal-gv | 0.3.2 | Viruses (including giants) | Meta by default in CLI | Viral genomes |
| BRAKER3 | 3.0.8 | Eukaryotes | Evidence-based | High-quality eukaryotic annotation |
| tRNAscan-SE | 2.0.12 | All domains | Domain-specific | tRNA detection |
| Infernal `cmsearch` | 1.1.5 | All domains | Rfam covariance models | rRNA (SSU/LSU/5S/5.8S) and other ncRNA |

> **Retired from this workflow:** AUGUSTUS as a standalone tool (now invoked only through BRAKER3); standalone `prodigal-gv` (use pyrodigal-gv); `barrnap` (replaced by Infernal `cmsearch` against domain-specific Rfam models).

## Documentation Format

Each tool guide includes:
- Official documentation URLs
- Installation commands
- Key command-line flags
- Common usage examples for gene calling
- Input/output format specifications
- Performance optimization tips

## Usage Notes

- All tools are installed via pixi (see pixi.toml in skill root)
- Examples assume tools are in PATH
- Adjust thread counts based on available resources
- Check tool-specific QC recommendations
