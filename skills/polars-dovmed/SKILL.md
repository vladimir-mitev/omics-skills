# polars-dovmed

Search PubMed Central Open Access and bioRxiv parquet corpora with `polars-dovmed`.

Use the bundled helper, `skills/polars-dovmed/scripts/query_literature.py`, for hosted API or local parquet-backed searches. The helper auto-loads `~/.config/polars-dovmed/.env`.

Run the helper with `uv run --script` so its pinned Parquet fallback dependency is available. Local runs record `--corpus-revision` (or `DOVMED_CORPUS_REVISION`) and fall back from `flattened.csv` to `processed.parquet` or the legacy `prcoessed.parquet` only when the compact output is absent.

Current hosted API defaults:
- Treat API keys as secrets in artifacts. Do not save keys in run directories, memory records, summaries, or final answers.
- Save generated run artifacts under `tasks/polars-dovmed-runs/<slug>/` by default, not under `skills/polars-dovmed/`.
- Prefer structured async search through `/api/jobs` targeting `scan_literature_advanced(mode="discovery")`.
- Do not use the flat `/api/search_literature` endpoint for smoke tests or normal skill work. It is opt-in only with `--allow-flat-query` and may hang behind the edge proxy.
- Do not start with `--corpus both`. Run `--corpus biorxiv` and `--corpus pmc` as separate calls, then merge results.
- For OpenPMC/PMC, do not run a broad unbanded scan. Use the materialized clean year bands in parallel with direct FTS-backed calls: `--sync --year-bands clean_split --year-band-workers 4`.
- If the user names a specific publication year or narrow range, map it to the matching clean band(s) and search only those bands. Use all clean bands only when no year constraint is given.
- For recent or emerging taxa, run bioRxiv anchor-only discovery and OpenPMC clean-band discovery as separate searches. bioRxiv is small and often returns first; OpenPMC should still use parallel clean bands.
- For any entity-centric prompt with topic modifiers, such as "distribution and genomics of X", first search the exact entity/aliases only. Treat topic words as triage labels or a second-pass refinement after confirming anchor hits; do not build a large first-pass query of generic topic terms.
- Do not invent aliases by splitting compact taxon, gene, or clade names into common words unless the prompt or literature supports that synonym. Keep aliases evidence-based; when a real synonym is multi-word, keep it as one phrase in a single JSON term.
- For OpenPMC clean-band discovery, skip automatic details rerank: pass `--skip-details-rerank`. The FTS index searches title, abstract, and full text, but PMC details lookups still read parquet and can dominate wall time. Fetch details only for selected PMCID values after discovery.
- Citation metadata should come from the corpus response/details endpoint first. If DOI/year/journal are missing, use bounded Crossref lookup through `--crossref-metadata` or the `crossref-lookup` skill. Do not use generic web search for DOI repair except as a final publisher-page check for unresolved/ambiguous records.
- If OpenPMC clean-band search returns `Database not found`, stop and report that the deployment is not exposing the indexed OpenPMC bands. Do not fall back to a monolithic unbanded OpenPMC scan.
- For interactive work, pass `--poll-timeout` and, when available, wrap searches in `timeout`. Do not rerun OpenPMC with longer waits after one bounded clean-band failure.

Public access note:
- `omics-skills` does not provide a hosted API key or the PMC/bioRxiv parquet corpora.
- Public users can prepare local PMC searches from Uri Neri's upstream package: <https://github.com/UriNeri/polars-dovmed>.
- Local setup uses upstream `dovmed download`, `dovmed build-parquet`, and `dovmed scan`.
- If no API key and no local corpus exist, state that `polars-dovmed` is not configured and use another literature fallback.

## Instructions

1. Route the task and decide execution mode.
   - Use the hosted API when `POLARS_DOVMED_API_KEY` is configured in the environment. Never pass the key in argv.
   - Use local `dovmed scan` when hosted access is unavailable and local parquet paths exist.
   - Do not imply that this repo ships hosted access or local corpora.
2. Create a dedicated run directory.
   - Default: `tasks/polars-dovmed-runs/<date-topic>/`.
   - Save `prompt.txt`, `query.json`, submitted payloads, raw responses, timing files, and any curated summary.
   - Never save secrets.
3. Author a structured query JSON directly.
   - Start with exact anchor names and aliases.
   - Add relation groups only when they improve precision.
   - Use `disqualifying_terms` for acronym collisions and wrong systems.
   - For "hosts of X" or other recent-taxonomy prompts, first run an anchor-only query for X and aliases; use host terms during triage or a second pass.
   - For "topic of X" prompts, such as environmental distribution, genomics, metabolism, or ecology of an entity, keep the first query anchor-only. Do not add broad words like distribution, genome, environment, host, or taxonomy as peer OR concepts.
4. Inspect the query JSON before searching.
   - Check spelling, taxonomy aliases, regex escaping, and noisy terms.
   - Keep support terms soft in discovery; avoid generic anchors such as `host` alone.
5. Run discovery first.
   - bioRxiv API path: `--queries-file ... --mode discovery --corpus biorxiv`.
   - OpenPMC API path: `--queries-file ... --mode discovery --corpus pmc --sync --year-bands clean_split --year-band-workers 4 --skip-details-rerank`, unless the prompt has a year constraint that maps to fewer bands.
   - Use `--extract-matches none --add-group-counts primary`.
   - Use bounded polling, for example `--poll-timeout 75` for bioRxiv and `--poll-timeout 120` for OpenPMC clean bands.
   - Keep `--details-rerank-limit` modest, usually 8-12, and use it automatically only for bioRxiv or non-year-band searches. For OpenPMC, fetch details by PMCID after inspecting top hits.
6. Inspect the first 5-10 hits.
   - If results are noisy, refine `query.json` and rerun.
   - For citation-quality answers, first use PMCID/DOI details from polars-dovmed, then `--crossref-metadata` or `/crossref-lookup` for missing DOI/year/journal. Use DOI landing pages or journal pages only when Crossref and corpus metadata disagree or remain ambiguous.
7. Record timings when the user asks about speed.
   - Capture wall time with shell `time -p` or `timeout ...`.
   - Also report helper/API `elapsed_ms` when present.
   - Timeouts and failed endpoints are valid measured results; do not hide them.

## Hosted API Reachability

Minimal reachability check:

```bash
curl -sS --max-time 20 https://api.newlineages.com/
```

Expected: service metadata from the root endpoint. This only proves the service is reachable, not that a corpus scan is healthy.

Structured smoke check:

```bash
RUN=tasks/polars-dovmed-runs/smoke-$(date +%Y%m%d)
mkdir -p "$RUN"
cp skills/polars-dovmed/fixtures/smoke_prompt.txt "$RUN/prompt.txt"
cp skills/polars-dovmed/fixtures/smoke_query.json "$RUN/query.json"

timeout 90s uv run --script skills/polars-dovmed/scripts/query_literature.py \
  --queries-file "$RUN/query.json" \
  --corpus biorxiv \
  --mode discovery \
  --max-results 3 \
  --skip-details-rerank \
  --poll-timeout 75 \
  --save-payload "$RUN/payload_smoke.json" \
  --save-response "$RUN/results_smoke.json" \
  > "$RUN/summary_smoke.json" 2> "$RUN/time_smoke.txt"
```

If `timeout` is unavailable, still pass `--poll-timeout` and record that no outer wall-clock guard was available. Avoid `/usr/bin/time`; use shell `time -p` unless you have confirmed the path exists.

Known client pitfall: Cloudflare can reject Python `urllib`'s default user agent with HTTP `403` and error code `1010`. The helper sends a normal user agent. If raw `urllib` is unavoidable, send both `X-API-Key` and `User-Agent`.

## Preferred Workflow

### Step 1: Author Query JSON

Use compact concept groups:

```json
{
  "anchor_entity": [
    ["primary_name"],
    ["alias_1"],
    ["alias_2"]
  ],
  "relation_or_property": [
    ["primary_name", "relation_term"],
    ["alias_1", "specific_relation_alias"]
  ],
  "disqualifying_terms": [
    ["term_to_exclude"]
  ]
}
```

**Group logic** (enforced consistently on both the FTS fast path and the parquet
scan): terms inside one inner group are AND'd (all must co-occur); inner groups
within a concept are OR'd; concepts are OR'd, with ranking favoring items that
match more groups. A multi-word term is matched as an exact phrase. So list
synonyms/aliases as **separate single-term groups** (each `["alias"]` on its own
line) — never pack them into one group, which would require them all to co-occur.
Use a multi-term group only to require co-occurrence (e.g. `["entity", "relation"]`).

For recent taxa or sparse terms, begin with anchor-only JSON:

```json
{"anchor_entity": [["Mirusviricota"], ["mirusvirus"], ["mirusviruses"]]}
```

### Step 2: Search With Hosted API

Fast first pass for emerging taxa:

```bash
RUN=tasks/polars-dovmed-runs/mirusviricota-hosts-$(date +%Y%m%d)
mkdir -p "$RUN"
printf '%s\n' "papers describing hosts of Mirusviricota" > "$RUN/prompt.txt"
# Write and inspect "$RUN/query.json" before running the search.

timeout 90s uv run --script skills/polars-dovmed/scripts/query_literature.py \
  --queries-file "$RUN/query.json" \
  --corpus biorxiv \
  --mode discovery \
  --extract-matches none \
  --add-group-counts primary \
  --max-results 25 \
  --details-rerank-limit 12 \
  --poll-timeout 75 \
  --save-payload "$RUN/payload_biorxiv.json" \
  --save-response "$RUN/results_biorxiv.json" \
  > "$RUN/summary_biorxiv.json" 2> "$RUN/time_biorxiv.txt"
```

OpenPMC pass with parallel clean year bands:

```bash
timeout 120s uv run --script skills/polars-dovmed/scripts/query_literature.py \
  --queries-file "$RUN/query.json" \
  --corpus pmc \
  --mode discovery \
  --sync \
  --year-bands clean_split \
  --year-band-workers 4 \
  --extract-matches none \
  --add-group-counts primary \
  --max-results 25 \
  --skip-details-rerank \
  --poll-timeout 120 \
  --save-payload "$RUN/payload_pmc.json" \
  --save-response "$RUN/results_pmc.json" \
  > "$RUN/summary_pmc.json" 2> "$RUN/time_pmc.txt"
```

For citation metadata enrichment after a shortlist, prefer bounded Crossref
fallback over web search:

```bash
uv run --script skills/polars-dovmed/scripts/query_literature.py \
  --details PMC6362216 PMC10132079 \
  --corpus pmc \
  --crossref-metadata \
  --crossref-limit 10 \
  --save-payload "$RUN/payload_details.json" \
  --save-response "$RUN/results_details.json"
```

If the prompt gives a year constraint, map it before searching:
- `<=2009` -> `pre_2010`
- `2010-2020` -> `2010_2020`
- `2021-2023` -> `2021_2023`
- `>=2024` -> `2024_plus`

For a range crossing bands, pass an explicit comma list to `--year-bands`, for example `--year-bands 2021_2023,2024_plus`. Use a single `--year-band` only when the whole requested range is inside one band.

Fetch details directly when you already know identifiers:

```bash
uv run --script skills/polars-dovmed/scripts/query_literature.py \
  --details PMC6912108 PMC8490762 \
  --corpus pmc \
  --save-payload "$RUN/payload_details.json" \
  --save-response "$RUN/results_details.json"
```

For bioRxiv details, pass DOI values with `--corpus biorxiv`.

### Step 3: Search Locally With dovmed scan

Use local mode when hosted access is unavailable or explicitly unwanted.

```bash
uv run --script skills/polars-dovmed/scripts/query_literature.py \
  --execution-mode local \
  --corpus pmc \
  --local-parquet-pattern "$DOVMED_PMC_PARQUET" \
  --queries-file "$RUN/query.json" \
  --save-payload "$RUN/payload_local.json" \
  --save-response "$RUN/results_local.json"
```

Local corpus aliases:
- `--corpus pmc`: set `DOVMED_PMC_PARQUET` or pass `--local-parquet-pattern`.
- `--corpus biorxiv`: set `DOVMED_BIORXIV_PARQUET` or pass `--local-parquet-pattern`.
- `--corpus both`: only with one compatible explicit parquet pattern; otherwise run separate scans.

## Search Semantics

- Prefer structured JSON over ad hoc natural-language search strings.
- Build searches around anchor concepts first.
- List alternate names and spelling variants as separate single-term groups within a concept (groups are OR'd); keep a multi-word synonym as one phrase term. Multiple terms in one group are AND'd (all must co-occur) — now enforced on the FTS fast path too, so never pack synonyms into a single group.
- Treat support concepts as refiners, not anchors.
- For "X of Y" prompts, combine X and relation terms inside an OR-of-AND group only after an anchor-only discovery pass if recall is poor.
- Down-rank papers matching only generic support terms or full-text-only background mentions.

Ranking priority:
1. exact anchor hit in title
2. exact anchor hit in abstract
3. anchor plus support co-occurrence in title or abstract
4. multiple distinct relevant group matches
5. full-text-only matches

## Quick Reference

| Task | Action |
|------|--------|
| Run directory | `tasks/polars-dovmed-runs/<date-topic>/` |
| Preferred query | Authored `query.json`, inspected before search |
| Preferred hosted path | helper `scan_literature_advanced(mode="discovery")`; async except FTS-backed OpenPMC clean bands |
| Emerging taxon first pass | `--corpus biorxiv`, anchor-only query, bounded timeout |
| OpenPMC pass | separate `--corpus pmc --sync --year-bands clean_split --year-band-workers 4 --skip-details-rerank` call |
| Year-constrained OpenPMC | map requested years to one or more clean bands before searching |
| Avoid by default | flat `/api/search_literature`, `--corpus both`, unbanded broad OpenPMC |
| Details endpoint | `--details ... --corpus pmc|biorxiv` |
| Missing DOI/year | `--crossref-metadata` or `skills/crossref-lookup/scripts/lookup --title ...` |
| Local fallback | `--execution-mode local --local-parquet-pattern ...` |
| Quick verification | `uv run --no-project python skills/polars-dovmed/scripts/smoke_test.py --run-dir tasks/polars-dovmed-runs/smoke-test` |
| Timing | shell `time -p`, helper `elapsed_ms`, and timeout status |

## Input Requirements

- A literature search prompt or inspected structured `query.json`.
- Hosted API key or local parquet files for the requested corpus.
- Writable run directory outside the skill source tree.

## Output

- `prompt.txt`, `query.json`, payload JSON, raw response JSON, timing files, and optional curated summary.
- Paper list with titles, identifiers, corpus, relevance notes, and timing.
- Warnings for timeout, 502, database-not-found, missing metadata, or fallback use.

## Quality Gates

- [ ] API key handled as a secret and not persisted.
- [ ] Run directory is outside `skills/polars-dovmed/`.
- [ ] Query JSON authored and inspected before search.
- [ ] Hosted API root or helper smoke checked before declaring outage.
- [ ] Flat endpoint, `--corpus both`, and broad unbanded OpenPMC avoided unless explicitly justified.
- [ ] OpenPMC broad searches use direct parallel clean year bands with `--sync` and `--skip-details-rerank`; year-constrained searches use only matching bands.
- [ ] Discovery mode used before advanced refinement.
- [ ] First 5-10 hits reviewed and noisy terms refined.
- [ ] Long PMC scans have bounded poll and wall-clock timeout.
- [ ] Timings and failure modes reported when speed is part of the request.
- [ ] Citation metadata uses DB/details first, then bounded Crossref fallback; generic web search is not used for routine DOI repair.

## Examples

### Mirusviricota Host Search

1. Create `tasks/polars-dovmed-runs/mirusviricota-hosts-YYYYMMDD/query.json` with:

```json
{"anchor_entity": [["Mirusviricota"], ["mirusvirus"], ["mirusviruses"]], "disqualifying_terms": [["MIRU-VNTR"], ["mycobacterium"]]}
```

2. Run the bioRxiv hosted command from Step 2.
3. Inspect `results_biorxiv.json` and any companion details response.
4. Run the direct parallel OpenPMC clean-band command when PMC coverage is needed.
5. Summarize direct host evidence separately from background mentions.

### Local PMC Search

```bash
RUN=tasks/polars-dovmed-runs/klosneuvirinae-hosts
uv run --script skills/polars-dovmed/scripts/query_literature.py \
  --execution-mode local \
  --corpus pmc \
  --local-parquet-pattern "$DOVMED_PMC_PARQUET" \
  --queries-file "$RUN/query.json" \
  --save-payload "$RUN/payload_local.json" \
  --save-response "$RUN/results_local.json"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Flat `/api/search_literature` times out
**Solution**: Do not use it for smoke tests. Use the root endpoint plus structured helper smoke.

**Issue**: `--corpus both` returns 502
**Solution**: Run separate `--corpus biorxiv` and `--corpus pmc` calls and merge results manually.

**Issue**: OpenPMC `--year-bands clean_split` returns `Database not found`
**Solution**: Stop and report that the hosted deployment is not exposing the indexed OpenPMC bands. Do not retry as an unbanded full-corpus OpenPMC scan.

**Issue**: OpenPMC clean-band search times out
**Solution**: Report the measured timeout and keep the bioRxiv result. Do not retry the same OpenPMC query with a longer unbanded scan; narrow by user-specified year band or refine the anchor query.

**Issue**: A query about "topic of X" retrieves generic topic papers
**Solution**: Replace the first-pass query with exact entity aliases only. Use topic terms during manual triage or a focused second pass after confirming anchor hits.

**Issue**: DOI, year, or journal metadata is missing
**Solution**: Fetch details by PMCID/DOI first. If still incomplete, use `--crossref-metadata` or the `crossref-lookup` skill. Avoid generic web search unless both corpus metadata and Crossref are unresolved or conflicting.

**Issue**: `/usr/bin/time` is missing
**Solution**: Use shell `time -p` or record start/end timestamps; do not assume `/usr/bin/time` exists.

**Issue**: Artifacts were written under `skills/polars-dovmed/runs/`
**Solution**: Move future run artifacts to `tasks/polars-dovmed-runs/` and do not commit generated run outputs.

**Issue**: Hosted API key is missing and local parquet files are missing
**Solution**: State that `polars-dovmed` is not configured. Use another literature-search skill or ask the user to provide hosted access or local corpora.
