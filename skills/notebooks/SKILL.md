# Notebooks

A single skill for authoring, validating, and delivering reproducible analysis notebooks. Marimo is the default format; Jupyter is supported for existing `.ipynb` files and when a downstream tool requires JSON. Conversion between the two formats is part of this skill.

A notebook is not "done" until it has been executed end-to-end on a fresh kernel and every figure is embedded in the delivered file.

## Instructions

1. **Pick the format.**
   - New notebook: write a marimo `.py` notebook. Use the canonical cell layout (one concept per cell, final expression renders, no `if` guards around outputs, no `try/except` for control flow).
   - Existing `.ipynb` to extend or polish: keep it as Jupyter unless the user asks to convert.
   - Conversion: see "Convert between marimo and Jupyter" below.

2. **Outline before coding.** Write the notebook plan (purpose, data sources, analysis steps, expected outputs/plots) as the first markdown cell, then implement against that plan.

3. **Keep marimo cells clean.** These are hard rules for every `.py` notebook:
   - Markdown cells use one plain triple-quoted string: `mo.md(r"""...""")` or `mo.md(f"""...""")` only when interpolation is required. Put the prose directly inside the string; never paste quoted string fragments such as `" ... "` lines inside the markdown body.
   - Do not leave empty generated cells, whitespace-only cells, or `@app.cell def _(): return` placeholders. Remove them before final verification.
   - Do not accept a marimo "fix" prompt blindly. If one is accepted during interactive editing, inspect the diff immediately and remove unintended PEP 723/header/cell churn.

4. **Set up the kernel and dependencies.**
   - **Marimo.** Pin dependencies in the PEP 723 script header at the top of the `.py` file:
     ```python
     # /// script
     # requires-python = ">=3.12"
     # dependencies = [
     #     "marimo",
     #     "polars",
     #     "duckdb",
     #     "matplotlib",
     #     # ... add every import used in the notebook
     # ]
     # ///
     ```
     Run with `uvx marimo run --sandbox <notebook.py>` or edit interactively with `uvx marimo edit --sandbox <notebook.py>`. The sandbox reads the header and resolves the notebook environment.
   - **Jupyter.** Register a named ipykernel for the project's pixi env *before* the first execution and pin the kernel in the notebook metadata. The kernel name is mandatory — the generic `python3` kernel leaks the system interpreter:
     ```bash
     pixi run python -m ipykernel install --user --name <project> --display-name "<project> (pixi)"
     ```
     Then in `<notebook>.ipynb` confirm:
     ```json
     "kernelspec": {"name": "<project>", "display_name": "<project> (pixi)"}
     ```
     Add every import used in the notebook to `pixi.toml` so the kernel can resolve it from a clean install.

5. **Load data with project-relative paths.** Prefer DuckDB for TSV/Parquet (`duckdb.read_csv`, `duckdb.read_parquet`). Avoid absolute paths and `~`. Avoid hidden state from the runtime working directory.

6. **Run checks and all cells to generate plots.** Execute the notebook headlessly on a fresh kernel before delivery:
   - Marimo: run `uvx marimo check --strict <notebook.py>` before export. Then run `uvx marimo export ipynb <notebook.py> -o <notebook.executed.ipynb> --include-outputs --sandbox -f`. For a deterministic HTML artifact, use `uvx marimo export html <notebook.py> -o <notebook.html> --sandbox -f`. Run the strict check again after the final edit/export cycle.
   - Jupyter: resolve the installed skill root, then run its self-provisioning helper (or use the equivalent repo path while developing this skill):
     ```bash
     NOTEBOOKS_SKILL="${NOTEBOOKS_SKILL:-$HOME/.agents/skills/notebooks}"
     uv run --script "$NOTEBOOKS_SKILL/scripts/execute_notebook.py" \
       <notebook.ipynb> --kernel <project>
     ```
     The helper writes `<notebook>.executed.ipynb`. `pixi run jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace <notebook.ipynb>` is also valid when Jupyter is declared in the project environment.

7. **Evaluate the plots, then refine.** This step is required, not optional. After the run-all execution:
   - Open the executed notebook (or exported HTML) and visually inspect every figure.
   - Check for: empty axes, mis-scaled axes (log when linear was intended or vice versa), missing labels/legends, overlapping ticks, illegible font sizes at target output size, ambiguous palettes, colorbars without units, NaN-driven gaps, axis ranges clipping data, broken layouts.
   - For manuscript/paper figures, remove all in-plot titles and subtitles. Use axis labels, legends, panel letters, and manuscript captions instead.
   - Place each figure's caption/legend BELOW the figure: the figure (code) cell comes first and the caption (markdown) cell immediately follows it — never put the caption above the figure. A reader sees the figure, then its legend (journal convention).
   - If a figure is wrong or unclear, edit the source cell and re-run end-to-end. Repeat until each figure communicates what the surrounding markdown says it communicates.
   - Record what changed between revisions in a brief "Figure revision log" markdown cell or in the run log.

8. **Deliver pre-executed notebooks.** The artifact handed back to the user must:
   - Have every cell executed against the registered kernel.
   - Embed every figure (PNG / SVG cell outputs) directly in the `.ipynb` (or in the marimo HTML export).
   - Be reproducible from a clean clone: a new environment built from the PEP 723 header (marimo) or `pixi install` + `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute` (Jupyter) must reproduce the same notebook end-to-end.

9. **Convert between marimo and Jupyter** when the user asks for it:
   - Use `scripts/convert_notebook.py` for a pinned conversion path. The fixtures under `fixtures/` exercise both directions. Replace `<PROJECT_NAME>` and `<PIXI_PROJECT_KERNEL>` in copied Jupyter templates with the actual Pixi kernel before execution.
   - `.ipynb` → marimo `.py`: `uvx marimo convert <notebook.ipynb> -o <notebook.py>`, then `uvx marimo check --strict <notebook.py>`, then clean up Jupyter artifacts (`display()` calls, `%magic`s, indented final expressions, ipywidget usage). See `references/widgets.md` and `references/latex.md` for ipywidget→marimo and MathJax→KaTeX mappings.
   - marimo `.py` → `.ipynb`: `uvx marimo export ipynb <notebook.py> -o <notebook.ipynb> --include-outputs --sandbox -f`.
   - After conversion, re-run step 6 (check/execute), step 7 (inspect plots), and step 8 (deliver pre-executed).

## Input Requirements

- Notebook scope and goals (what question, what data, what output).
- Data file paths (TSV/Parquet preferred for DuckDB ingestion).
- For marimo: `uv` available on PATH, or `marimo` installed in the environment.
- For Jupyter: `pixi` available and a `pixi.toml` (or equivalent env spec) for the project.

## Output

- A reproducible notebook (`.py` for marimo, `.ipynb` for Jupyter) with narrative markdown cells, code cells, and embedded figures.
- A pre-executed copy (`<notebook>.executed.ipynb` or an `.html` export) where every cell has been run on a fresh kernel.
- A short "Figure revision log" recording any plot-revision rounds.

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Notebook format chosen explicitly (marimo by default; Jupyter only when justified or when the input is `.ipynb`).
- [ ] Kernel registered and pinned: marimo PEP 723 header complete, or Jupyter `kernelspec` set to a named pixi kernel.
- [ ] Every Python import used in the notebook is declared in the dependency spec (PEP 723 header or `pixi.toml`).
- [ ] Data paths are project-relative and verified to exist.
- [ ] Headless run-all succeeds on a fresh kernel: marimo export uses `--include-outputs --sandbox`, or Jupyter execution exits zero.
- [ ] Every figure is inspected after execution; any figure that fails the visual checks above triggers a code revision and re-run.
- [ ] Manuscript/paper figures have no in-plot titles or subtitles.
- [ ] Delivered notebook has every cell pre-executed with figures embedded; users do not have to run the notebook to see the plots.
- [ ] For marimo: `uvx marimo check --strict <notebook.py>` passes before and after export.
- [ ] For marimo: no malformed markdown cells, quoted-string fragments inside `mo.md(...)`, trailing empty cells, or `return`-only placeholder cells remain.
- [ ] Template dependencies use bounded versions and no delivered notebook retains the literal `<PIXI_PROJECT_KERNEL>` placeholder.
- [ ] Jupyter-to-marimo and marimo-to-Jupyter conversions both pass the fixture gate.

## Examples

### Example 1: New marimo notebook

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = ["marimo", "polars", "duckdb", "matplotlib"]
# ///

import marimo
app = marimo.App(width="medium")

@app.cell
def _():
    import marimo as mo
    import polars as pl
    import duckdb
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    return mo, pl, duckdb, plt

@app.cell(hide_code=True)
def _(mo):
    mo.md(r"""
    # Analysis notebook

    This notebook loads project data, validates it, and renders the requested figures.
    """)
    return

@app.cell
def _(duckdb):
    df = duckdb.read_parquet("data/measurements.parquet").pl()
    df.head()
    return (df,)

@app.cell
def _(df, plt):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3.2))
    ax.scatter(df["x"], df["y"], s=10)
    ax.set_xlabel("x (units)"); ax.set_ylabel("y (units)")
    fig
    return
```

Then:
```bash
uvx marimo check --strict notebook.py
uvx marimo export ipynb notebook.py -o notebook.executed.ipynb \
  --include-outputs --sandbox -f
uvx marimo check --strict notebook.py
```

### Example 2: Jupyter notebook with a named pixi kernel

```bash
# One-time kernel registration in the project root:
pixi run python -m ipykernel install --user --name myproject --display-name "myproject (pixi)"

# After authoring, run end-to-end on a fresh kernel:
NOTEBOOKS_SKILL="${NOTEBOOKS_SKILL:-$HOME/.agents/skills/notebooks}"
uv run --script "$NOTEBOOKS_SKILL/scripts/execute_notebook.py" notebooks/analysis.ipynb \
  --kernel myproject \
  --out notebooks/analysis.executed.ipynb
```

### Example 3: Convert `.ipynb` to marimo

```bash
uvx marimo convert notebooks/legacy.ipynb -o notebooks/legacy.py
uvx marimo check --strict notebooks/legacy.py
uvx marimo export ipynb notebooks/legacy.py -o notebooks/legacy.executed.ipynb \
  --include-outputs --sandbox -f
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Jupyter notebook executes locally but fails on a teammate's machine.
**Solution:** The kernel was unpinned (`python3`) or used a packaged interpreter outside the project's pixi env. Re-register a named kernel and pin it in the notebook `kernelspec`.

**Issue:** Marimo cell does not render a figure.
**Solution:** The figure must be the final expression of the cell. Indented expressions inside `if` blocks or expressions buried before other statements will not render.

**Issue:** Figures look correct interactively but the executed file shows empty plots.
**Solution:** Code is mutating shared state across cells (e.g. `plt.gcf()` reuse). Build a fresh `fig, ax = plt.subplots(...)` per cell and return / display `fig` as the final expression.

**Issue:** Converted notebook fails `marimo check`.
**Solution:** Remove leftover `display(...)` calls, drop `%magic` lines that have no marimo equivalent, and rewrite ipywidget usage using `mo.ui.*` per `references/widgets.md`.

**Issue:** Every matplotlib figure appears twice in the executed Jupyter notebook.
**Solution:** The inline backend's `flush_figures` post-execute hook auto-displays every open figure (`display_data`), and the cell's `fig` return value produces a second copy (`execute_result`). Unregister the hook in the preamble cell:
```python
plt.ioff()
try:
    from matplotlib_inline.backend_inline import flush_figures
    get_ipython().events.unregister("post_execute", flush_figures)
except Exception:
    pass
```
With this fix, only the cell's final `fig` expression renders. For figures inside `if/else` blocks (where `fig` is not a top-level expression and therefore not captured as `execute_result`), use `display(fig)` explicitly instead of bare `fig`. Do not use `mpl.use("agg")` as a workaround — it disables `_repr_png_()` entirely and produces zero images.
