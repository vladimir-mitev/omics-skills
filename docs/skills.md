# Skills

Each directory under `skills/` requires a `SKILL.md`. Its frontmatter gives the name and short description. Its body gives instructions, inputs, outputs, quality gates, and references. Optional subdirectories hold examples, scripts, tool notes, reference material, and reusable assets.

The table below is a reader-facing map. The source `SKILL.md` files are still canonical.

## Literature, Metadata, and APIs

| Skill | Use when | Main result |

## Skill Source Links

The source directory for every skill is available under [`skills/`](https://github.com/fmschulz/omics-skills/tree/main/skills). When editing a skill, keep the `SKILL.md` frontmatter `name` equal to the directory name and rebuild the catalog afterward.
